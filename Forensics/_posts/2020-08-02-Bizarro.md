This thing looks... bizarre? Can you find any secrets it may have?

Download the file below.

## Solution

We check the given file with `file` command and find out that it is a zip file. So unzipping it with

```
unzip bizzaro.zip
```

we get a folder with a `.bzr` subfolder. Searching on google, we find out that it belonged to `Bazar version control system`. Searching for some commonly used Bazar commands we came across the log command. Trying it out we got

```
bzr log

We see 402 commits each with a bizzare commit message. We Tried to base64 decode the messages but we got nothing, so we proceeded to check the changes in each commit. We see that, in every commit a file is addded which is then deleted in the succeeding commit. Trying to move to random older revisions using `bzr revert` and looking at the files, we see that they are empty. So, to confirm if all files were empty I wrote a python script to print all the revisions along with the file contents:

```
import os

for i in range(1,404,2):
    cmd = 'bzr diff -r' + str(i) + ' --diff-options --side-by-side'
    print(os.system(cmd))
```

This gave us the flag which was inside one of the files.

## Flag

```
flag{is_bazaar_bizarre_or_is_it_just_me}
```
