We are in the cat cage! Only the good cats get treats!

Connect here:

## Solution

After visiting almost all directories for which we had permissions and reading all the files in them we finally tried:

```
cat -A get_flag
```

which revealed the flag concatenated to non-printable characters inside the file.

## Flag

```
flag{thats_a_good_trick_heres_some_catnip}
```
