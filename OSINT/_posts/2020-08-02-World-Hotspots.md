What can you tell me about 9C:EF:D5:FB:9F:F0?

## Solution

Searching in [wigle.net](https://wigle.net/) for the BSSID and zooming out fully, we will see a purple mark. Zooming in towards the mark, we see:

![alt-text]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/World-Hotspots/flag.png)

## Flag
```
flag{network_osint}
```
