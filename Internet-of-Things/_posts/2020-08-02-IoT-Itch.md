Brought to you by IoT Village. Support in #iot-village on the Discord server.

See if you have the patience to scratch the itch; patience is key. Mosquitto bites are so annoying!

Connect with:
nc 209.97.159.20 1883

## Solution

At first we were clueless on what to do, but later there was a hint in the `iot-village` channel that asked us to search `iot+mosquito` for leads. Trying that out we got to know that the port supported [mqtt](http://mqtt.org/) protocol. So we wrote a python script to connect to it and **patiently**(took more than 20 minutes) waited for the flag.

```python
import sys
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
 
def on_message(mqttc, obj, msg):
    print(msg.topic+" "+str(msg.qos))
    print(msg.payload)
 
mqttc = mqtt.Client()
mqttc.on_message = on_message
 
mqttc.connect("209.97.159.20", 1883, 60)
mqttc.subscribe("#", 0)
mqttc.loop_forever()
```

## Flag
```
flag{m05qu1770_b17e5_4R3n7_50_B4D}
```
